# @aliran/broadcaster

Ingests streams and seeds them to the P2P swarm as **encrypted** feeds. Channels are
runtime start/stoppable — via the env config (single channel, back-compatible) or the
authed HTTP **control API** (multi-channel).

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # set PANEL_PUBKEY, INPUT, STREAM_ID
npm install               # requires ffmpeg on PATH
node src/index.js
```

To manage channels over HTTP instead (add/configure/start/stop at runtime):

```bash
node src/control-cli.js add-admin op    # prompts for a password (min 8 chars)
CONTROL_ENABLED=1 node src/index.js     # control API at http://127.0.0.1:3310
```

Opening that address in a browser loads the **control UI** (`control-ui/`, plain
HTML/JS, no build step): sign in to add/edit channels — ingest kind (push kinds the
host ffmpeg can't do are hidden) and per-channel transcode (unusable encoders
disabled, probe error as tooltip) — start/stop them, copy a push channel's **push
URL** off its card, read the ffmpeg **log ring** (live dialog; last lines inline on
an unhealthy card), and watch live status with honest state badges (ON AIR / WAITING
FOR PUBLISHER / RETRYING). Set `PUBLIC_HOST` so push URLs show your real hostname.
Channel art is a panel admin operation — upload it in the panel dashboard, not here.

With the control API enabled, the env-configured channel starts only if `STREAM_ID`
is explicitly set; it keeps the legacy `DATA_DIR`-root store, so existing feed
identities (and pre-seeded `feed.key` files) are preserved. See `docs/reference.md`
for the endpoints.

## Inputs

Channels take a typed `input` (strings auto-upgrade; the control API accepts objects):

- `{"kind":"rtmp","port":1935,"streamKey":"…"}` — RTMP listener; push from **OBS** to
  `rtmp://<host>:<port>/live/<streamKey>`. The key is auto-generated when omitted and
  is obscurity, not authentication — firewall the port, or prefer SRT.
- `{"kind":"srt","port":5000,"passphrase":"…","latencyMs":200}` — SRT listener; the
  passphrase IS enforced by the SRT handshake (the recommended authenticated push).
- `{"kind":"udp","port":5000,"timeoutMs":10000}` — raw MPEG-TS over UDP.
- `{"kind":"pull","url":"rtsp://… | https://…/live.m3u8 | rtmp://… | srt://… | udp://…"}`
  — live pulls run unpaced (no `-re`); plain-http VOD files are paced to realtime.
- `{"kind":"file","path":"/media/loop.mp4"}` (looped) · `{"kind":"test"}` (bars + tone).
- Env shorthand: `INPUT=rtmp` → RTMP listener on `RTMP_PORT` (the push URL with the
  generated stream key is printed at startup); `INPUT=<url>` → pull; `INPUT=<path>` → file.

Push ports are unique per channel and auto-allocated from
`INGEST_PORT_BASE`–`INGEST_PORT_MAX` (default 5000–5999) when omitted — remember to
open them on the firewall for your encoder. A per-channel `transcode` object selects
the encoder (`libx264`, `copy` passthrough, or GPU: `h264_nvenc`/`h264_qsv`/
`h264_vaapi`/`h264_amf`), resolution, fps, bitrate and preset; GPU encoders are
deep-verified by a real test encode at startup and a channel that needs an unusable
one is refused with the probe's error (no silent fallback). With `copy`, set the
encoder's keyframe interval to `HLS_TIME` seconds so segments cut cleanly.

## The feed is a rolling buffer (disk vs RAM)

Live segments are **not archived**: the playlist (`index.m3u8`) is the source of
truth, and everything that rotates out of the window is deleted from the drive and
its blob storage reclaimed — a channel that streams for weeks occupies O(window)
space, not O(history). The window defaults to **8 segments of ~2 s** (≈16 s,
`HLS_TIME` / `HLS_LIST_SIZE`): short segments cut time-to-first-frame, and 8 is still
a real shareable window for peers to re-seed each other. Deepen `HLS_LIST_SIZE`
(12–16) for large swarms.

Two buffer modes (`FEED_BUFFER` env or per-channel `buffer` field):

- **`disk`** (default) — one persistent on-disk core. The `feedKey` and its DHT
  discovery topic are **stable across restarts**, so a returning viewer rejoins a
  *warm* topic and resumes its on-disk replica instead of cold-discovering a brand-new
  core — markedly faster time-to-play and healthier P2P. The rolling reclaim keeps
  storage window-bounded (tens of MB), not byte-flat.
- **`ram`** — the feed lives in memory as a **session core**: every `start()` mints a
  fresh feed keypair and registers the new `feedKey` with the panel, and segment data
  never touches disk. (Reusing one keypair over an emptied RAM store would fork the
  core and break existing replicas — a restart is a new session by design, which is
  why every restart costs viewers a fresh DHT discovery.) Viewers follow along without
  re-login: the SDK resolves the CURRENT `feedKey` from the replicated catalog at play
  time. Choose this only when the host disk must stay byte-flat.

In both modes the **encryption key persists** (`feed.key` in the channel's store
dir) — user grants seal it, so restarts never invalidate access.

See [`../docs/kb/feed-buffer.md`](../docs/kb/feed-buffer.md) for the P2P tuning
rationale (why disk wins for time-to-play, and how to size the segment window).

## Test it (no Android needed)

```bash
node src/index.js                                   # prints feedKey + encKey
node ../tools/viewer.js <feedKey> <encKey>          # play at http://127.0.0.1:<port>/index.m3u8
# or the automated proof:
node ../tools/e2e-stream-test.mjs                   # PASS = end-to-end P2P verified
```

## Status / TODO

- [x] Encrypted Hyperdrive feed + Hyperswarm seeding
- [x] Persist/reuse the feed encryption key across restarts
- [x] ffmpeg ingest → live HLS (test pattern / RTSP / HLS / file), `out/ → drive` mirror
- [x] Verified end-to-end (ffmpeg → P2P → localhost → ffprobe) via `tools/e2e-stream-test.mjs`
- [ ] `PROTECTION=drm` path via a multi-DRM packager (CENC/CMAF, CPIX keys) — v1.x
- [x] Auto-register stream + metadata with the panel over an authenticated RPC
      (set `PANEL_PUBKEY` + `PUBLISHER_KEY` from `admin-cli init`) — verified `test:register`
- [x] Multi-channel: runtime start/stop via `ChannelManager` + authed control API
      (`CONTROL_ENABLED=1`) — verified `npm run test:broadcaster-api`
- [x] Web control UI (`control-ui/`) served by the control server — login, channel
      add/edit/start/stop, live status (ffmpeg/peers/registered/playlist)
- [x] Reliability: ffmpeg **watchdog** (auto-restart with backoff / stalled-edge restart),
      channels **auto-resume** after a broadcaster restart (persisted desired state),
      **`isLive:false` on stop** via one shared panel link (boot catch-up heals stale-live),
      and a per-channel ffmpeg **log ring** — verified `npm run test:broadcaster-api`
- [x] Ingest/transcode/logs surfaced in the control API + UI: `GET /api/capabilities`,
      `GET /api/channels/:id/logs`, status `state` + `ingest.pushUrl`, kind/transcode
      forms + logs dialog + state badges — verified `npm run test:broadcaster-api` + live browser
- [ ] Optional peer allowlist check before replicating
