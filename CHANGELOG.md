# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project scaffold: `panel/`, `broadcaster/`, `client/` structure.
- Documentation under `docs/` (getting-started, concepts, architecture with sequence
  diagrams, security model, operator guide, configuration, content management, client
  build, user management, reference, FAQ/troubleshooting, legal/compliance) + ADRs.
- `ROADMAP.md` (alpha → 1.0 milestones + optional modules) and a publishable MkDocs
  Material site config (`mkdocs.yml`).
- Repository metadata: README, LICENSE (MIT), SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, Code of Conduct.

### v0.1 progress — "it streams" (verified)
- Broadcaster: ffmpeg → live HLS → **encrypted** Hyperdrive → Hyperswarm seeding
  (`broadcaster/src/hls.js`, `index.js`); persisted feed encryption key.
- Localhost Range media server over a Hyperdrive replica (`tools/lib/serve-drive.js`),
  ported into the client Bare worklet (`client/backend/backend.mjs`).
- Desktop P2P viewer (`tools/viewer.js`) + automated end-to-end test
  (`tools/e2e-stream-test.mjs`): a fresh peer discovers the feed over the DHT,
  replicates the encrypted feed, serves it locally, and ffprobe confirms valid
  H.264/AAC. **P2P transport proven on desktop.**

### v0.2 progress — secure login (verified)
- `@aliran/core`: OPRF (ristretto255), Argon2id verifiers, X25519 key sealing,
  proof-of-work — 6 unit tests (`npm run test:core`).
- Panel: signed account/catalog control plane (`admin-cli`), and a login RPC with
  proof-of-work + per-(user,peer) throttling + oblivious OPRF evaluation
  (`panel/src/rpc.js`, `panel/src/index.js`).
- Client: runtime-agnostic OPRF login (`client/backend/login.mjs`), wired into the Bare
  worklet; recovers per-user stream keys from the signed DB.
- End-to-end test (`npm run test:login`): panel + broadcaster + client login →
  entitlement → P2P playback (ffprobe-validated); wrong password rejected.

### v0.2 progress — sessions & device limits (verified)
- `@aliran/core`: per-user Ed25519 auth keypair (`authKeyPair`/`authSign`/`authVerify`)
  and panel-signed session tokens (`token.js`); +2 unit tests (8 total).
- Panel: `session` RPC — client proves login by signing the panel's challenge; the panel
  enforces `maxDevices` (evict oldest), issues a signed token, updates the signed record;
  revocation via `tokenVersion`. Enrollment stores `authPub`/`authPrivEnc`.
- Client: `login.mjs` completes the session step and verifies the returned token;
  `checkSession()` for offline validation.
- Tests: `npm run test:session` (device eviction, forged-sig rejection, revocation);
  `test:login` now also asserts a valid session token.

### v0.2 progress — broadcaster auto-registration (verified)
- Panel generates a **publisher keypair** at `init` (secret goes in the broadcaster
  `.env` as `PUBLISHER_KEY`). Broadcaster signs a `register` RPC; the panel verifies,
  writes the public catalog record, and stores the encryption key privately.
- `broadcaster/src/register.js` + wired into `index.js` (auto-registers on start).
- Test: `npm run test:register` (register → private secret, unauthorized rejected,
  grant → login recovers the registered key).

### v0.2 progress — assets pipeline (verified)
- Panel seeds an assets Hyperdrive; its key is advertised in the signed DB
  (`meta/assetsKey`). `admin-cli upload-art <stream> <poster|backdrop|logo> <file>`
  writes art and updates the catalog. Client opens the assets replica and serves
  `/assets/*` over the localhost media server.
- Test: `npm run test:assets` (upload → P2P replication → localhost serve, bytes match).

### Android client progress — Bare backend runs on-device (verified)
- `client/` is a real `react-native-tvos` 0.83 project (`android/` native build, app id
  `com.aliranclient`); `react-native-bare-kit` boots a Bare worklet with JS↔Bare IPC.
- The P2P backend bundles with `npm run bundle-backend` (bare-pack, `--preset android`)
  and the **full Holepunch native addon stack loads on Android** — sodium-native (4.x
  **and** 5.x), udx-native, quickbit/rabin/simdle/crc, fs-native-extensions — packaged
  per-ABI by bare-kit's `bare-link` gradle step from npm prebuilds (no cross-compiling).
- Worklet-runtime gaps shimmed: `node:crypto` → `@aliran/bare-node-crypto`
  (sodium-backed WebCrypto, wired via the bare-pack global imports map),
  TextEncoder/TextDecoder/`globalThis.crypto` polyfills (`client/backend/globals.mjs`),
  and an Android-aware corestore path (worklet cwd is `/`).
- Verified on the emulator: the real `app.bundle` worklet boots and reports
  `{type:'ready'}` (smoke screen in `client/src/WorkletSmokeTest.tsx`).

### Android client progress — OTT UI: login + catalog browse (verified)
- Login screen performs the OPRF login through the worklet (retrying while the DHT
  dials) and navigates Login → Home → Player (react-navigation, screens pinned 4.25.0).
- Home screen: category rails + featured hero + LIVE badges; poster/backdrop art is
  replicated P2P from the panel's assets drive and served by the worklet's localhost
  server, which now starts at login on one persistent port (asset URLs stay valid
  across playbacks) — art fields arrive in `{type:'streams'}` as ready-to-use URLs.
- Android release builds permit cleartext HTTP **only to loopback** via a network
  security config — required for the on-device media/assets server (API 28+ blocks
  cleartext by default; also needed by the S6c video player).

### To do (see ROADMAP.md and per-package READMEs)
- Catalog `bee.watch()` live push to the UI.
- OTT UI + client app: native Android build (phone + TV), Keystore session sealing.
- Optional (v1.x): multi-DRM, geo-locking, VOD.
